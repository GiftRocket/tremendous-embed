# Tremendous Embed

The Tremendous Embed SDK is the easiest way to add rewards to your application, while maintaining control of the redemption experience for your recipients. Within your application, end-users are presented with a white-label interface wherein they can choose to receive funds from among a wide catalog of options.

You can check out the [documentation](docs/documentation.md) for how to get set up and running.
