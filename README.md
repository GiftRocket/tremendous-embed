# Tremendous Embed

![Embed Demo](./images/example.png?raw=true)

The Tremendous Embed SDK is the easiest way to add rewards to your application, while maintaining control of the redemption experience for your recipients. Within your application, end-users are presented with a white-label interface wherein they can choose to receive funds from among a wide catalog of options.

We've included two things in this repo that will help you get set up:

* [Documentation](docs/documentation.md) for how to get set up and running
* [A demo application](docs/demo.md) showing a full integration

If you have questions about integrating, reach out to us at developers@tremendous.com
